# Image Scribe: Visual Content Narration
Machine Learning


**Image Scribe** is an image captioning project that generates natural language descriptions for images. It leverages the Flickr8k dataset and deep learning techniques to create a bridge between visual content and textual narration. The generated captions provide context and understanding for the content within images, making them more accessible and informative.

## Getting Started

To get started with Image Scribe, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Download the Flickr8k dataset or provide the dataset's path.

4. Run the project and start generating captions for your images.

## Project Components

The project consists of several components:

1. **Data Preparation**: Reading and preprocessing image captions from the Flickr8k dataset. Captions are in the format "startseq [caption] endseq."

2. **Image Encoder**: Utilizing an off-the-shelf image encoder (Inception V3) to create image embeddings for each image. These embeddings provide a numerical representation of the visual content.

3. **LSTM Language Generator**: Training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to generate language sequences (captions) based on the encoded image representations.

4. **Decoder and Caption Generator**: Creating a decoder function to convert LSTM-generated language sequences into human-readable captions. Combining image and language generation to create complete captions for images.

5. **Beam Search**: Implementing beam search to refine and optimize the generated captions, improving their quality and coherence.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images along with five captions for each image. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k).

Please ensure you have the dataset and set its path before running the project.

## Data Preparation

Image captions in the dataset are read and preprocessed to create a dictionary with image filenames as keys and tokenized captions as values.

## Image Encoder

Images are processed using the Inception V3 pre-trained model, generating image embeddings (vectors) to represent the visual content. These embeddings are used as input for the caption generator.

## LSTM Language Generator

An LSTM-based language generator is trained on the tokenized captions to learn the language patterns in the dataset.

## Decoder and Caption Generator

A decoder function is used to convert LSTM-generated language sequences into natural language captions. These captions provide a textual description of the image content.

## Beam Search

Beam search is employed to enhance the generated captions by selecting sequences that optimize the likelihood of producing coherent and contextually relevant captions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Download or set the path to the Flickr8k dataset.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to generate captions for your images.

## Results

The project's effectiveness is measured by the quality and relevance of the generated captions. Results are evaluated using metrics like BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) to assess the quality of the generated text.
